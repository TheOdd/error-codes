# Summary
The idea of this web application is very simple:

*To allow for easy and quick access to information on HTTP response codes.*

# Features
* Filter for a specific response code number
* Access additional information on any response code in a popup modal
* ***Additional features may be added at some point and current goals can be found in the [TODO Issue](https://github.com/TheOdd/http-codes/issues/1)***

# Where can it be accessed?
Currently, the web application can only be accessed via building it from the source found here. I plan to host it at a custom domain as soon as I'm able to get it all up and running.
